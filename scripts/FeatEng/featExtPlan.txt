# Details the plan for feature extraction from the multimetallic nanoparticles raw data (.xyz files)
- Generate the features from each software/package into different files, combine them later on if necessary
- Could do them in small batches of instance
- Better consider similarity between different configurations before starting to extract the features (archetypal analysis to find the minimum set containing the most information?)

- Generate features using modified NCPac:
    - Test if feasible for large nanoparticles
    - Otherwise might need to parallelise?
    - Element-specific features

- Generate features using modified scripts from Ben Motevalli's GitHub repository on graphene nanoflakes:
    - Element-specific features

- Generate features using Partycls Python package:
    - Check if applicable

- Generate common descriptors using DScribe Python package:
    - Coulomb matrix (CM)
        - Use nuclear charges for metallic elements?
        - Matrix form?
        - represent whole structure (could be helpful for measuring similarity of structures)
    - Sine matrix (SM)
        - Use nuclear charges for metallic elements?
        - Matrix form?
    - Ewald sum matrix (ESM)
        - Use nuclear charges for metallic elements?
        - Matrix form?
    - Atom-centered Symmetry Functions (ACSF)
        - represent local environment near an atom using fingerprint composed of multiple two- and three-body functions that can be customised to detect specific structural features
        - could do output stratification based on chemical identity of central species
        - Matrix form?
    - Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)
        - encode regions of atomic geometries using local expansion of Gaussian smeared atomic density with orthonormal functions based on spherical harmonics and radial basis functions
        - output partial power spectrum vector
    - Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR)
        - encode structure using distribution of different structural motifs
        - easily visualised, highly interpretable, correspond to specific structural properties of system
        - represent whole structure (could be useful for measuring similarity of structures)
    - Local Many-body Tensor Representation (LMBTR)
        - modified for local environment
        - use chemical species for central position, possible to encode spatial locations that aren't centered at any particular atom
